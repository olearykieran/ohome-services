              Prices are too high for a full remodel, but a basic cleaning won&apos;t get
              the job done. If you want to make your preexisting home look like it&apos;s
              brand new, we are the ones to call. After working in the residential
              construction industry for several years, we realized that many Long Island
              families have the need and desire to renovate but the prices are just too
              unreasonable. We offer various solutions to keep the price at a fraction of
              the cost that a general contractor would charge for a full remodel.
